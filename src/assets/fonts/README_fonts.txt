Font files must be:
	- Monospaced (square recommended! but not required on windows version)
	- .BMP
	- Two colors, any more will not be palette swapped
	- Black on first color index, background color
	- White on second color index, text color
	- 16x8 characters (multiply with character width and height for your resolution)

In Aseprite you can ensure the proper colors by right clicking layer > make background (which fills with your secondary color)
then Sprite > Color Mode > Index, arranging the palette as stated above, and exporting as .bmp

The default screen resolution is 640x480, the same as the Miyoo Mini+
font sizes that fit this screen include:
4*, 5, 6*, 8*, 10, 12*, 15, 16, 20, 24*
*fits perfectly

Outside of that suggestion, there is no programmed limitation.
If the font size is too big to fit the screen, it will attempt to interpolate

ASCII Character map is currently as follows
 ~!/-.:'()<>#@^?
0123456789ABCDEF
GHIJKLMNOPQRSTUV
WXYZacdfg

In loaded files, the characters after ~ can be represented as ABCDEFGHIJKLMNO in order (due to OS naming restrictions)
 
Cannonically, the # @ ^ ? is treated as symbols Face Note Heart (Currently Unused)
The rest of the image is used for flourish and UI elements
I would encourage creativity, especially that the face symbol is unique to your font :3
