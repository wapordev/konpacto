Themes! Maybe if this program gets used, ill make a place to store community fonts and themes

If not stated, themes are made by the author of this program
KAzzy.png made by Azra Reyes @krisp.bsky.social
Kemi.png made by Emilia
Kleahpacto made by Underscoreleah https://underscoreleah.itch.io/

Kp8* fonts are ones from the original pico-8 version of konpacto :3
Kp8ami.png is a homage to the beloved LSDJ

Themes must be:
	- 4x1 pixels of ideally 4 unique colors
	- .png

This is conveniently the output of lospec.com's PNG Image (1x) button!
Though manual tweaking of the order is usually required, to taste
especially if the palette has more than 4 colors
